# Source (src) Folder

This folder will contain all of our main MATLAB code. By main code, I mean all of the code that is needed to run the facial recognition itself. This does NOT include code that you just run once or twice to perform a certain action, but that the facial recognition algorithm will never run. That code goes in the `scripts` folder.
